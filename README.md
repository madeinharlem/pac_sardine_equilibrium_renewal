# Pacific sardine equilibrium renewal model
This repository contains the code for an equilibrium Pacific sardine renewal model.  


Optimal_age_compute matrix.R contains the function for computing optimal age of first capture under different harvesting scenarios.  


sardine_equilibrium.R contains the status quo model+ functions for varying optimal ages of first capture by varying prices.  

We start with one recruit

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_{a&plus;1}=(1-v_ah)s_aN_a)  

The code is commented for the interested reader.

Kapish!
