# Pacific sardine equilibrium renewal model
This repository contains the code for an equilibrium Pacific sardine renewal model.  


Optimal_age_compute matrix.R contains the function for computing optimal age of first capture under different harvesting scenarios.  


sardine_equilibrium.R contains the status quo model+ functions for varying optimal ages of first capture by varying prices.
